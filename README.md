# JavaScript Unit Tests ðŸ§°

In this project, some functions were implemented to solve proposed problems, and to ensure that the implementation of the methods were correct, it was made unit tests.

In this project, I was able to:

- Write unit tests using the NodeJS Jest module to verify the correct functioning of the functions;
- Write functions so that they meet already implemented tests;
- Write tests and functions using a test-driven development approach.

src/ path corresponds to where the functions are located.</br>
tests/ path corresponds to where the tests are located.
